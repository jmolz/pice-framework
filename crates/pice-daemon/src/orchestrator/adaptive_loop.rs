//! Async adaptive pass loop — Phase 4.
//!
//! Drives the per-layer evaluation through the four [`AdaptiveAlgo`] variants
//! (`BayesianSprt`, `Adts`, `Vec`, `None`). Owns pass state, invokes the
//! provider(s), feeds scores to [`decide_halt`] (and [`run_adts`] when ADTS
//! is active), records per-pass metrics BEFORE the halt-decision check, and
//! returns a summary outcome for the caller to persist on the manifest.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - **Sink writes happen BEFORE the halt decision.** A budget-halted loop
//!   still persists the triggering pass cost. Enforced by the call order in
//!   the loop body and tested in `crates/pice-daemon/tests/adaptive_integration.rs`.
//! - **`next_*_params` reset after non-ADTS verdicts.** ADTS flags apply
//!   only to the immediately following pass; a `Continue` verdict rolls
//!   them back to the project baseline. Missing this causes escalation bleed.
//! - **`escalation_events` only populated for ADTS.** Other algorithms
//!   never emit level transitions; `LayerResult.escalation_events` stays `None`.
//! - **Confidence ceiling (0.966) is enforced in `decide_halt`.** This
//!   module just returns what `decide_halt` reports.
//! - **`run_adts` exhaustion is the only halt that does NOT go through
//!   `decide_halt`.** ADTS divergence is the orchestrator's concern, per
//!   [`pice_core::adaptive::decide`]'s contract.

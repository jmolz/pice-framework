//! Per-layer evaluation orchestrator (Stack Loops engine).
//!
//! Drives the nested per-layer evaluation loops: for each DAG cohort,
//! each layer's diff is filtered to its globs, a context-isolated prompt
//! is built, and a provider session evaluates the layer's contract.
//!
//! Phase 1 focuses on the orchestration flow — diff filtering, manifest
//! recording, and DAG traversal. Provider evaluation is best-effort;
//! when the provider can't start (normal in test environments), the
//! orchestrator records a placeholder result and continues.

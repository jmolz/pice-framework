This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

PICE CLI is an open-source workflow orchestrator for structured AI coding. It implements the Plan-Implement-Contract-Evaluate (PICE) methodology as a Rust-powered CLI with a TypeScript provider bridge, orchestrating AI coding sessions through a formal lifecycle with dual-model adversarial evaluation and quality metrics. Architecture uses a JSON-RPC provider protocol (inspired by MCP) enabling community-built providers for any AI coding tool.

- `.claude/PRD.md` — the v0.1 MVP PRD (shipped, 217 tests, treat as historical baseline)
- `PRDv2.md` — the post-v0.1 roadmap spec (v0.2 Stack Loops, v0.3 Arch Experts + Dashboard, v0.4 Implicit Contract Inference, v0.5 Self-Evolving Verification). Read this before starting any v0.2+ work.

**Versioning note:** v0.1 architecture (single `pice` binary, CLI-only) is what currently ships. v0.2 introduces a **headless daemon + CLI adapter split** — the Rust core becomes a long-running `pice-daemon` process; `pice` becomes the first of several adapters (CLI, dashboard, CI) that communicate with the daemon over a Unix socket / named pipe. When working on v0.2 code, read `.claude/rules/daemon.md`, `.claude/rules/stack-loops.md`, and `.claude/rules/workflow-yaml.md`.

## Commands

```bash
# Development — Rust
cargo build                    # Build CLI binary
cargo test                     # Run Rust tests
cargo clippy                   # Lint Rust code
cargo fmt --check              # Check Rust formatting

# Development — TypeScript
pnpm install                   # Install TS dependencies
pnpm build                     # Build all TS packages
pnpm test                      # Run TS tests
pnpm lint                      # Lint TS code (eslint)
pnpm typecheck                 # Type check (tsc --noEmit)

# Full Validation (run before every commit)
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build && cargo build --release
```

**Expected baseline:** 769 Rust tests (1 ignored), 76 TypeScript tests, 0 lint errors, 0 warnings, clean release build. One test (`handlers::tests::dispatch_plan_errors_without_provider`) is known-flaky due to timing — retry on spurious failure.

## Architecture

The CLI follows a **Provider Architecture** pattern:

```
pice-cli (CLI adapter)
├── Arg parsing ──── clap, shell completions
├── Adapter layer ── inline mode or socket → pice-daemon
└── TTY rendering ── terminal output, streaming display

pice-daemon (headless daemon)
├── Handlers ──── 11 command handlers (init, plan, execute, evaluate, etc.)
├── Orchestrator ── provider session lifecycle, streaming
├── Metrics ──── SQLite writer + aggregation + telemetry
├── Templates ── embedded scaffolding (rust-embed)
├── Provider host ── spawns and manages provider processes
│    ↕ JSON-RPC over stdio
└── Providers (TS) ── Claude Code, Codex, future community providers
```

**Data flow:** User command → Rust core (parse, config, state) → JSON-RPC → Provider (SDK session) → JSON-RPC → Rust core (metrics, output)

**Evaluation flow (Tier 2+):** Rust core launches Claude + Codex providers in parallel via tokio. Claude grades contract criteria. Codex challenges the approach. Core synthesizes a unified report.

**Provider contract:** Providers declare capabilities (`workflow`, `evaluation`, or both) during `initialize`. The core routes commands accordingly — workflow to Claude Code, evaluation to both.

## Code Patterns

### Naming
- Rust files: `snake_case.rs`
- Rust types/structs: `PascalCase`
- Rust functions/methods: `snake_case`
- Rust constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- TS files: `kebab-case.ts`
- TS types/interfaces: `PascalCase`
- TS functions: `camelCase`
- CLI commands: `kebab-case` (e.g., `pice plan-feature` if multi-word)

### Imports
- Rust: Use `use` with explicit imports, avoid glob imports (`use crate::config::*`)
- TS: Named imports, no default exports. Use `@pice/` workspace aliases.

### Error Handling
- Rust: Use `thiserror` for library errors, `anyhow` for CLI-level errors. Never `unwrap()` in library code. `unwrap()` only in tests or where a panic is the correct behavior.
- TS: Typed errors via discriminated unions. Never swallow errors silently. Provider errors must be surfaced through JSON-RPC error responses.
- Provider failures are non-fatal for the core — the CLI must gracefully degrade (e.g., single-model eval when adversarial provider fails).

### CLI Output
- Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output. When `--json` is passed, suppress human-friendly messages (`println!`) and emit a single JSON object to stdout.
- Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = failure, 2 = evaluation failed (contract criteria not met).

### Session Lifecycle
- All provider-backed commands use `session::run_session()` or `session::run_session_and_capture()` from `engine/session.rs`. Never duplicate the create → send → destroy lifecycle in command files.
- For streaming output in text mode, use `session::streaming_handler()` — not inline notification handler closures. **In JSON mode (`req.json`), do NOT install the streaming handler** — chunks written to stdout corrupt the JSON response.
- Commands that need the AI's response text (commit, handoff) use `run_session_and_capture()`. Commands that only stream (prime, review, plan, execute) use `run_session()`.
- The caller registers the notification handler before calling `run_session()`. The session module owns the handler for `run_session_and_capture()`.

### Git Index Safety
- Commands that auto-stage (`git add -u`) must use an RAII drop guard (`AutoStageGuard`) that calls `git reset` in `Drop`. This guarantees index restoration on ALL exit paths — including `?` propagation and panics — not just explicitly handled branches. The guard is `disarm()`ed only after a successful `git commit`.
- Never generate commit messages from a diff that includes files outside the staged set. Stage first, then build the prompt from `get_staged_diff()`.
- Check `git status` exit code before inspecting stdout — non-git directories return empty stdout but non-zero exit.

### Phase Scaffolding
- Code intended for future phases uses `#[allow(dead_code)]` with a comment explaining which phase will use it (e.g., `/// Used by interactive sessions in Phase 3+.`). This keeps the codebase warning-free while allowing architectural scaffolding.

### Async Commands
- All CLI commands are `async fn` and run on the tokio runtime (`#[tokio::main]`). Phase 1/3/4 commands that don't need async yet are trivially async (same body, `async fn` signature).

### Logging
- Rust: Use `tracing` with structured fields. Levels: `error` (user-facing failures), `warn` (degraded behavior), `info` (lifecycle events), `debug` (detailed flow), `trace` (protocol messages). Tracing output goes to stderr via `.with_writer(std::io::stderr)`.
- TS: Use `console.error` for provider-side errors (stderr, not stdout — stdout is the JSON-RPC channel).

## Testing

- **Rust framework**: Built-in `#[test]` + `cargo test`
- **TS framework**: Vitest
- **Rust test location**: `src/` inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules for unit tests, `tests/` for integration tests
- **TS test location**: `__tests__/` directories alongside source, or `*.test.ts` co-located
- **Run**: `cargo test && pnpm test`
- **Minimum coverage**: Each new feature needs: 1 happy path, 1 edge case, 1 error case per public function
- **Provider testing**: Use the stub/echo provider for integration tests — never depend on live API calls in CI
- **JSON-RPC protocol tests**: Both sides (Rust + TS) must have serialization roundtrip tests for every message type

---

## Dual-Model Adversarial Evaluation

This project uses **dual-model adversarial evaluation** as a core feature, not an add-on. During `pice evaluate`:

- **Tier 1** (Tier 1 changes): Single Claude evaluator — contract grading only
- **Tier 2** (new features): Claude evaluator + Codex adversarial review in parallel
- **Tier 3** (architectural): Claude agent team (4 evaluators) + Codex xhigh adversarial review

Evaluators see ONLY: contract JSON, git diff, CLAUDE.md. Never implementation context.

Users configure models via `.pice/config.toml` `[evaluation]` section. Both API key and subscription auth are supported.

## Key Rules

- **Never `unwrap()` in library code** — use `?` operator with proper error types. Panics in the CLI core are bugs.
- **stdout is the JSON-RPC channel for providers** — all provider logging goes to stderr. Writing to stdout breaks the protocol.
- **Provider failures must not crash the CLI** — gracefully degrade (single-model eval, warning messages) instead of panicking.
- **Evaluation sessions are context-isolated** — evaluator prompts must NEVER include implementation conversation or planning rationale. Only: contract, diff, CLAUDE.md. In v0.2+, the rule extends to **per-layer context isolation**: a layer evaluator only sees its own layer's contract + filtered diff + CLAUDE.md, never other layers' contracts, findings, or plan rationale.
- **Templates are embedded at build time** — changes to `templates/` require a rebuild. Use `rust-embed` or `include_str!`.
- **JSON-RPC protocol changes require both Rust and TS updates** — `pice-protocol` crate and `@pice/provider-protocol` package must stay in sync. Add roundtrip serialization tests for every new message type.
- **Never commit API keys or secrets** — auth is handled via environment variables or subscription OAuth flows, never hardcoded.
- **All CLI commands go through the provider protocol** — no direct SDK calls from Rust. The protocol IS the abstraction boundary.
- **(v0.2+) CLI and daemon share parsing/validation via `pice-core`** — never duplicate config, layer, workflow, or manifest parsing logic in `pice-cli` and `pice-daemon`. Both depend on `pice-core`; the CLI previews what the daemon will execute, so divergence is a bug.
- **(v0.2+) The verification manifest is the source of truth** — daemon reads and writes `~/.pice/state/{project-hash}/{feature-id}.manifest.json` (namespaced by project hash to prevent cross-repo collisions); every adapter (CLI, dashboard, CI) observes the same manifest. Never build parallel state stores. Writes use crash-safe atomic persistence (fsync + rename + dir fsync).
- **(v0.2+) Daemon RPC is a separate protocol from provider RPC** — the provider protocol is `pice-daemon`↔`provider` (spawn+stdio). The daemon RPC is `pice-cli`↔`pice-daemon` (socket+newline-JSON). They use JSON-RPC 2.0 but are DIFFERENT method namespaces, different consumers, different transports. Do not conflate.
- **(v0.2+) Honor the ~96.6% confidence ceiling** — for dual-model correlated evaluators, confidence reports must never claim higher than the correlated-Condorcet ceiling (`docs/research/convergence-analysis.md`). Adaptive algorithms halt at the target; they do not pretend more passes breach the ceiling.
- **(v0.2+) Always-run layers cannot be skipped** — `infrastructure`, `deployment`, `observability` layers execute regardless of change scope, unless explicitly overridden in `workflow.yaml` and logged to audit trail. When always-run layers have empty diffs, they are `Pending` (not `Skipped`) — seam checks / static analysis will evaluate them.
- **(v0.2+) Dependency cascade is transitive** — if database changes activate `api` (depends_on database), `frontend` (depends_on api) also activates. Layers activated by cascade with no own file changes are `Skipped`; always-run layers with no changes are `Pending`.
- **(v0.2+) Fail closed on evaluation** — layers are NEVER marked `Passed` without real provider-backed evaluation. Phase 1 records `Pending` status. The manifest overall status is `InProgress`, not `Passed`, until provider scoring runs.
